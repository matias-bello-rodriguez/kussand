  # Optional: If you want GitHub to trigger the Render deploy strictly after build passes.
  # Note: For this to work, you need to:
  # 1. Go to Render Dashboard -> Settings -> Auto Deploy -> Toggle "No"
  # 2. Copy "Deploy Hook URL"
  # 3. Add it to GitHub Secrets as RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL
  #
  # deploy:
  #   needs: build
  #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  #   if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  #   steps:
  #     - name: Deploy to Render
  #       run: curl -X POST ${{ secrets.RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL }}
